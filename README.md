## Run Locally

Start the backend service first, then open `index.html` in a browser.

Default backend API address:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

If the backend is deployed to another address, update `API_BASE_URL` in `app.js`.

## Main Workflow

1. The user enters an expression on the frontend.
2. The frontend sends the expression to `POST /api/calculate`.
3. The backend validates and calculates the expression.
4. The backend stores successful calculation records in SQLite.
5. The frontend reloads history from `GET /api/history`.

## API Usage

The frontend calls these backend endpoints:

```text
POST   /api/calculate
GET    /api/history
DELETE /api/history/{history_id}
DELETE /api/history
```

The frontend does not calculate the final result by itself. It only sends user input to the backend and renders the backend response.

## Browser Support

This page uses standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features. It can be opened directly in a modern browser after the backend is running.
